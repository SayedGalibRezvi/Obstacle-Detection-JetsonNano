DOCUMENTATION - PHASE 1

Project: Obstacle Detection using Jetson Nano + RPLIDAR + Camera

Progress:
1. Successfully connected RPLIDAR to Jetson Nano
2. Verified spin via ultra_simple.cpp
3. Read angle and distance via read_lidar.py
4. Attempted live 2D visualization via matplotlib (plot not working)
5. LIDAR tested on serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 with baudrate 256000

Next:
- Debug live plot refresh
- Integrate obstacle detection logic
- Add camera stream overlay
